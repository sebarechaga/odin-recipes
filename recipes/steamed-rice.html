    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Steamed rice is a great side for just about any protein, and there are so many different things you can do with rice, and this is a great "foundational rice" recipe. This recipe works great in a stock pot, rice cooker, or Insta-pot with a rice cooking setting.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup Rice</li>
            <li>1 Shallot or Onion (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Oil/Butter, etc.</li>
            <li>1 pinch Salt + more for personal taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Stock or Water</li>
            <li>All-Purpose Seasoning Blend (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh Herbs (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure your desired amount of rice, and either soak it in enough water to cover it for 3-5 minutes, or place rice into a metal strainer, and run under water until water runs clear.</li>
            <li>If using an onion or shallot with your recipe, peel and dice small while the rice is rinsing.</li>
            <li>Using a pot or vessel with a tight lid place the oil or butter into the cooking vessel, and if using an onion or a shallot, saute the onion, stirring frequently for 1-3 minutes. If you are not, skip to step #4</li>
            <li>Add the rice to the cooking vessel and toast the rice in the oil, stirring frequently for 1-3 minutes at a low temperature.</li>
            <li>Add the salt and the liquid to the cooking vessel, stir to combine and raise the temperature to high until the liquid begins to boil softly. Follow the manufacturer's directions if using a rice maker or an Insta-pot</li>
            <li>If using a stock pot, cover the cooking vessel (if not done already), reduce the heat, and set a timer for 15 minutes <strong>(Please note: if using wild rice, brown rice, etc. follow the manufacturer's directions as they take longer to cook.)</strong></li>
            <li>If you are going to add fresh herbs, wash and chop all your herbs while the rice is cooking, and once the cooking time is complete, remove the top, and stir to the bottom to see if most of the water has evaporated. If not, return the top, and cook for 3-5 minute intervals, or until the water has been absorbed. When done, taste for seasoning, and add additional salt, seasoning blend, and/or fresh herbs if desired.</li>
        </ol>
